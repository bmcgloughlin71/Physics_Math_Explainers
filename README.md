# Physics and Math Explanations

# Introduction
The main idea behind this project is to explain as simply as possible (but no simpler!) math or physics concepts that were not explained well to me.

Concepts in math or physics that are traditionally misunderstood ought to be placed in this project. 

# Concepts Explained

- **The Shannon-Nyquist Sampling Theorem** \- This theorem says that in order to be able to uniquely reconstruct a signal, one must sample *at least* twice the frequency of the signal that you are trying to reconstruct. Is this intuitive? If you had 5 billion samples that were sampled at 1.9999 times the frequency of the signal you were trying to reconstruct, would it really be impossible to uniquely reconstruct this signal? 
- **The Transverse Traceless Gauge (WIP)** \- Gravitational Waves distort spacetime. This distortion is described by 10 numbers (the 10 unique components of the metric tensor). However the distortion can actually be sufficiently described with only 2 numbers. Why is this? 
- **Levers(WIP)** \- "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world." - Archimedes. How and why do levers work?
