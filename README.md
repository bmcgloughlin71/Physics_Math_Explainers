# Physics and Math Explanations

# Introduction
The main idea behind this project is to explain as simply as possible (but no more simpler!).

Concepts in math or physics that are traditionally misunderstood ought to be placed in this project. 

# Concepts Explained so Far

- The Shannon-Nyquist Sampling Theorem
